#Introduction to HEN

= Introduction =

This is based Total_Noob.'s 6.20 HEN.

Soon after TN released HEN, many people found it doesn't work well with PSP3000 4g.
VFlame released a patch so solve this problem in 6 hours.
Meantime, other hackers started reverse engineer of both TN HEN and VFlame patched version.



= Details =

After I tried to post my initial works on Wololo/talk, JJS and FrEdDy shared their findings which boost my progress tremendously. Actually they have gain much more than what I've found. I would hereby say thanks to both of them, and Wololo, of course, for his great HBL and Wololo/talk.

So far JJS has contributed his reversed C code for HEN loader, and FrEdDy has posted the rebootex. I also finished the VFlame loader and started looking rebootex.

Hopefully I could finally work out the whole rebootex (with help from others, of course). So that we could have a strong base for the HEN in the future.
